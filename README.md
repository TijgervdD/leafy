# Project LEAFY
The code to run the robot is called "Complete Code"
The code must be run in the Testing Envirionment (env), because this is where all the needed packages are installed

To test each component there are the following codes:
2_DC_motor_control: DC motor testing
Distance_measurement: DC motor testing + ultrasonic sensor
Relais: solenoid valve/relais testing
Servo: servo testing
Button: button testing

To setup the Raspberry pi 5 because it died or fried, go to the file "setup the Pi-5". 
Here a full step by step can be found to install the pi and connect to the GIT.

In the folder Other-Files-Design you can find the design files for Fusion and the STL for 3D printing.

In the AI folder you can find all the codes for the AI plant recognition

In the Old folder you can find all the old codes that were used in this project but not applicable for the final design
