The code to run the robot is called "FinalBEAST42"

The AI code to test how green a plant is and if it needs water is called "Green\_plant\_test.py"


The code must be run in the codeEnv Environment (env), because this is where all the needed packages are installed

To setup the Raspberry pi 5 because it died or fried, go to the file "setup the Pi-5".
Here a full step by step can be found to install the pi and connect to the GIT.

To test each component there are the following codes:
2\_DC\_motor\_control: DC motor testing
Distance\_measurement: DC motor testing + ultrasonic sensor
Relais: solenoid valve/relais testing
Servo: servo testing
Button: button testing

In the folder Other-Files-Design you can find the design files for Fusion and the STL for 3D printing.

In the AI folder you can find all the codes for the AI plant recognition

In the Archive folder you can find all the old codes that were used in this project but not applicable for the final design
